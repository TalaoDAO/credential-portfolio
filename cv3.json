I started in working in the big data before that existed.          More than 10 years in the production of e-tourism solutions: manage millions of rates and as many reservations have no secrets for me.          My expertise in software engineering does not stop at the technical delivery aspects, but extends further to strategic planning of the system, scalability, maintenance, extensibility, market positioning, training and documentation coverage. I love to accompany courageous entrepreneurs. I provide them with solutions to optimize each department of the company. Technology is an ingredient, understanding is a recipe. Every day, my team of developers allows me to get new opportunities. It s a constantly evolving field, and we have the energy to follow it. Thanks to the communication and the humor.",
