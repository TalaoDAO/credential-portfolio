Overview
========

Talao markets its professional data certification solution on the Ethereum Blockchain to companies and other organizations such as schools or training centers.

Our marketing and sales actions are therefore primarily aimed at companies, which is why we communicate little with talent directly. These companies directly offer their talents (either employees, trainees or freelancers) to issue certificates related to a successful mission, and to open a Blockchain CV — Freedapp — to store these certificates and associate them with experiences or competencies. The acquisition of talent to use our protocol is therefore carried out via our customers directly. 

To date, several commercial leads have been brought to us by members of our community, with a business contributor remuneration scheme.

Objectives 
----------

For Companies and Talents, the issuance of certificates on the blockchain with Talao protocol has several interests:

- Attracting the new talents by allowing them to value the experience they will have with the company (including during the recruitment process), and thus their future employability

- Spreading the image of an innovative and modern company through the use of blockchain technology, which is adopted above all by the younger generations

- Mastering what the talents say about their mission and their activity in the company, and in particular avoiding the dissemination of confidential, sensitive or erroneous information

- Valuing their own talents externally, for example with their clients, by presenting them with CVs with certificates signed by former clients. This is particularly relevant for service companies.

Distributed Identity vs Centralized
-----------------------------------
Current architectures to validate, certify, and manage identity are based on centralized, top-down approaches that rely on trusted authorities and third-party operators. 
We approach the problem of digital identity starting from a human rights perspective, with a primary focus on identity systems in the developed world. 

We assert that individual persons must be allowed to manage their personal information in a multitude of different ways in different contexts and that to do so, 
each individual must be able to create multiple unrelated identities.

Therefore, we first define a set of fundamental constraints that digital identity systems must satisfy to preserve and promote privacy as required for individual autonomy.

With these constraints in mind, we then propose a decentralized, standards-based approach, using a combination of distributed ledger technology and thoughtful regulation,
to facilitate many-to-many relationships among providers of key services. 
 
Our proposal for digital identity differs from others in its approach to trust in that we do not seek to bind credentials to each other or to a mutually trusted authority to achieve strong non-transferability. Because the system does not implicitly encourage its users to maintain a single aggregated identity that can potentially be constrained or reconstructed against their interests, individuals and organizations are free to embrace the system and share in its benefits.
