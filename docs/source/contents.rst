What is Talao ?
---------------

Talao is a Blockchain protocol to manage a professional Digital Identity.

Traditionnal architectures to validate, certify, and manage professional data are based on centralized, top-down approaches that rely on third-party private operators.
Unfortunatky these solutions often lead to inappropriate use of personal data and hacks. Whatever the GDPR could impose to private operators, the fact is that our data
are stored on their servers and they will utlimatly do what they want with our data.

Talao approaches this issue starting from a user perspective through a Blockchain decentralized Identity focused on professional data :

  - You own your data for your lifetime.
  - No private operators or government agencies can decide to update or delete your data.
  - No one can access your encrypted data without your permission.
  - No storage costs.
  - Certificates are tamper proof and tracable.
  - Certificates issuers are identified.

Talao allows Professional Identities for Talents, Companies and certificates issuers such as Schools or Training Centers.
It is for everyone the opportunity to use a new technology to get tamper proof professional data while keping the ownership of those data.

Identities with their certificates can be displayed anywhere on digital plateforms : social medias, websites, Jobboards, etc. They provide to third parties reliable data about professional experiences, skills and education.


How does Talao work ?
---------------------

Talao is based on Ethereum smart contracts Identities.
Smart contract Identities are like digital vault where you can store your data as diplomas, professional certificates, business contracts, pay slips,...
Each individual or company is given its own private key to access and update its Identity.

Thanks to cryptographic algorithms those private keys are only used to sign messages sent by the Identity owner to the Blockchain servers.
If someone wants to update its data, he/she will sign a message with a private key and send it to all Blockchain servers.
Each server will check the signature, update data then compare them to other server copies. As those data are duplicated on thousands of servers, no one can alone hack the Identity.

This Talao web application https://talao.co is a portal to access Identities with a simple User Interface and automated processus.

.. warning:: As this web application is a third party wallet, we strongly advise not to use your Identity address to store crypto currencies.


What Blockchain does Talao use ?
---------------------------------

Talao is available on the public Ethereum Mainet and Rinkeby. See https://github.com/TalaoDAO/talao-contracts for details.

Talao is also available on a private Ethereum network named TalaoNet.
TalaoNet runs a Proof Of Authority consensus (Clique) managed by the Talao team and partners.

To connect to this blockchain use RPC URL https://18.190.21.227:8502

Main contract addresses are :

- Talao token : 0x6F4148395c94a455dc224A56A6623dEC2395b99B
- Foundation : 0xb4C784Bda6A994f9879b791Ee2A243Aa47fDabb6
- Workspace Factory : 0x0969E4E66f47D543a9Debb7b0B1F2928f1F50AAf
