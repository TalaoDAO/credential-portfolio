Request a Certificate
=====================

There are 2 ways to request a certificate :

   - Through the "Request Certificate" of the Menu Bar if you have an email of the issuer.
   - Through the Search Bar if the issuer has his own Identity.

In the first case the Issuer Identity will be setup at the same time he will issue your certificate.
One needs to have the Issuer Identity to provide proof of existence of your Certificate.  

Fill the form to issue the Certificate as precisely as possible. It will be used by the Issuer to draft your Certificate.

Do not forget to write a memo to your Issuer. This memo wil be added as the first lines of the email.

The issuer will answer with an evaluation from 1 star to 5 stars to 4 questions. :

  - How satisfied are you with the overall elivery ?
  - How likely are you to recommend this talent to others ? 
  - How would you rate his/her ability to deliver to schedule ?
  - How would you rate his/her overall communication skills ?
  
All the data of this Certificate will be tamper proof. The certificate will be visible through a link to your Identity.
You can copy this link to your social media or send it to your future employeer or you can delete it. 

In order to strengthen your Certificate best is to get a Proof of the Issuer Identity and yours. See Next.
