=====================

If you are new and you do not have an Identity, it takes about 5 minutes :

  - First, create your own Identity. Go to https://talao.co/register/ and enter your firstname, lastname and an email for authentification.
  - When you receive your username and private keys go to https://talao.co to log and acces your Identity
  - Then clic on  "Request Credential" of the Menu Bar and follow the process.


.. note:: To request a Credential, you will need to know your referent's email. He/Her will receive an email with a link to setup your certificate.
   In order to have reliable data, the referent will also setup his/her own Identity during the process.
