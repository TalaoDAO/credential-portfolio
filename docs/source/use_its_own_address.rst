Use my own Ethereum Address
============================

Managing your Professional Identity through your own Ethereum Address gives you the possibility to keep the entire ownership of your data and receive certificates while using an easy website service to acces your Identity. 
However the limitations are :

   - you will not be able sign certificates for others,


The process to setup your Identity takes about 15 minutes and you need to master the signature of transactions on Ethereum through your wallet. 
 
If you want to use your own Ethereum Address to mamage your Professional Identity, follow the steps :

  - First, you need to get 100 TALAO tokens. You can get them on IDEX https://idex.market/eth/talao. If you cannot buy them there you can contat us at contact@talao.io.
  
  
  - Then you need to open an access to the Talao Protocol. This can be done through the TALAO token : go to https://etherscan.io/token/0x1d4ccc31dab6ea20f461d329a0562c1c58412515.  Select "Write Contract" in the menu, 
    then connect with web3 through your Ethereum Address (wallet Metamask, or others) to be able to send transactions to the contract. Look for createVaultAccess function (#11), fill the field with with value 0 and confirm the transaction.
    The transaction will lock 99.99 TALAO tokens from your Ethereum Address.

.. note:: Do not use an Ethereum Address with crypto funds. Best is to setup a specific Ethereum Address for your Professional Identity.
