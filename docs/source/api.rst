Talao Connect API
==================

Talao Connect APIs can be used for authentication, identification, claims issuance and more generally for Identity management.
For instance in the Human Resource sector it is an easy way to get reliable data about Talents and a powerfull and secure tool for onbarding user while keeping their data safe.

Those API do not provide basic account setup (details, signature, logo ...) which are available through the web platform https://talao.co .

Standard use cases for APIs are :

* Issue certificates to users (Talents, Companies,...).
* Onboard users who have their own Decentralized Identity.
* Outsource user data to their Digital Identity.
* Strenghen an employer brand with latest technology features like Blockchain Resume, Decentralized Identity,...

The Talao API server is an OpenId Connect server. We use OpenID Connect Autorization Code flow for authentification and OAuth 2.0 Authorization code flow and Client Credentials flow to manage user access to their identity.

Contact us relay-support@talao.io to open your Company Identity and receive your application granted permissions to use those APIs.

From the OIDC and OAuth 2.0 perspective :

* "Company" is the Client application
* "User" is the Resource Owner, it maybe a Talent or another Company
* "Talao API server" is the Authorization Server/Resource Server
