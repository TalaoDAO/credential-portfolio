An Alias is a new Username/email for authentification for the Relay (This web application).

At Identity creation, one smart contract is crated and one authentification email is encrypted and stored within this smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain. 
The address of the smart contract is the Decentralized IDentifier (DID) of your Identity. 
When you sign-in if the first time, you register a 3sernane to have a readable identifier associated to the smart contract address.

An Alias alias is another Username you can use with another email to access the Relay.

You can add as many Alias you want, for instance you can use an Alias for each of your device.
